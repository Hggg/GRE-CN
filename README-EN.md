# GRE-CN
GRE Preparation for Chinese students. 中文主导的GRE备考资料

## About
This repository contains my effort of getting the most GRE preparation documents into clean, readable, git-friendly format.
Files in this repo will be the ones I use in my own GRE study.

Since this tracks my own study progress, files are added progressively, and I will stop updating it after I'm done with GRE tests unless PRs are filed.

## Techniques
See the Chinese README.


## Naming Convention
The files are all named with the pattern `"L-" + "GRE-" + "Subject-" + "Source" + ".Extension"`. This is mainly due to the way
I name my own files in my computer, and these files are automatically exported and uploaded to this repo using a small tool.
